<p>The game takes place on a square grid where the Snake is constantly moving, and its direction can be controlled by the player using arrow keys. The objective of the game is to collect “food” squares that randomly appear on the grid. This will increase the size of the snake as well as the player’s score. The player must also prevent the snake from running into itself or into the outer boundaries of the grid, or else it is game over.</p>
